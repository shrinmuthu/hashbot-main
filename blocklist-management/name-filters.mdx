<Info>
**Be aware:** Blocklist management should be a routine task for the members of your team who manage your server's security. Although a Premium Plan includes templates to protect your server against the most common words used by impersonators and scammers, you will still need to monitor your server as usual and make additions to the Blocklist as needed.
</Info>

Over time, as you identify weak points and add more variations to your list, it will enhance your server's security. Eventually, it will require less input from you.
