title: "Manager Role(s)"
description: 'The "Manager" role is required to change Hashbot settings on your server or to edit the Blocklist. Be sure to only assign this role to trusted members of your team. Moderators do not need the ability to add and remove filters from Hashbot to be protected from impersonation (we will cover that in the next step). The necessity of this role will depend on your team structure.'
