You need to ensure that the Hashbot role is higher than any role you want Hashbot to moderate, and above all other bot roles. To move the role higher, simply click and drag the role to the desired position.

This is also a good time to include Hashbot in the allowlist of any other bots you have on your server. Ensure that other bots, like Wick, have not quarantined or disabled Hashbot!
