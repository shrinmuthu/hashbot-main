By default, the server owner will receive these notifications through DMs from Hashbot, but we recommend setting up a private channel instead.

To direct Hashbot to send these notifications to a specific channel, type `/settings logging set channel: <#channelname>`.

Ensure the channel exists before entering the command. You should see the channel appear in a pop-up list as you start typing its name.

  Example: `/settings logging set channel: #hashbot-log`

<Note>
  Make sure Hashbot can **View Channel**, **Send Messages**, **Read Message History** in that log channel!

  You can set that in the Discord channel <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid" size="18"/> settings <Icon icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" size="18"/> permissions
