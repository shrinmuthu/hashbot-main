<Info>
  Throughout this user guide, we will use \<brackets> to identify commands that you can customize. When using these commands on your server, be sure to remove the brackets.
</Info>

The first step you need to take is to get Hashbot into your server. You can either visit [https://hashbot.io/invite](https://hashbot.io/invite) or use the `/invite` command in any server that already uses Hashbot, and it will respond with an invite link for use or sharing.

1. A confirmation window will appear.

2. Select the server to which you want to add Hashbot and click "Continue."
