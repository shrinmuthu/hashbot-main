By default, Hashbot allows for three filters to be applied without a subscription. With a Premium Plan, you can add an **unlimited** number of filters. Additionally, you'll gain access to our curated template of commonly used words, which is regularly updated.

A Premium Plan also enables **PFP protection**. This feature prevents anyone in your server from using the PFPs of you, your team, or your server. If detected, Hashbot will automatically ban the user.

PFP protection also blocks bad actors from using popular PFPs commonly utilized by scammers. You can use our premade template with the most commonly used PFPs and expand the list with your own.
