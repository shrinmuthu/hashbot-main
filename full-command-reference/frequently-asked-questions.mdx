  <Accordion title="Wick bot is banning DM Disabler as soon as I try to add it to my server. How can I fix this?">
    This issue occurs because DM Disabler is a new bot, and Wick is treating it with suspicion. However, the Wick team has provided a workaround that allows you to add DM Disabler to your server.

    1. Disable the joingate using this command: `w!jg 1a ?off`
    2. Invite DM Disabler
    3. Enable the joingate again using this command: `w!jg 1a ?on`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I've added some keywords to my blocked list, but Hashbot is not banning bad actors!">
    Here are a few suggestions that might resolve the issues with your configuration:

    - Ensure the Hashbot role is positioned higher in your roles list.
    - Activate fuzzy mode if it is not already enabled.
    - Check that the name-filter is formatted correctly.
